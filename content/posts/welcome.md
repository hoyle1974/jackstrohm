Welcome to my first blog entry, nothing too exciting except a starting place to talk about what this blog will have on it.  I'm a software engineer who started coding decades ago and I'm still enjoying it.  I've been writing on Medium https://medium.com/@hoyle.hoyle but I'm going to also move my content here so I have more control over it. 

At the moment I'm doing a series on Kubernetes and building out infra from the ground up.  Along with the series will be a git repository with scripts to do everything I'm doing on my own.  I hope if you're interested you'll follow along.

Other topics I may talk about include Go, computer graphics, compression, and algorithms in general.  Let's see how this pans out!
